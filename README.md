# Aerial Image-Map Cross-Modal Matching Dataset

We  introduce a new large image dataset, named **Aerial Image-Map Cross-Modal Matching (AIMCM)** dataset. Specifically,  more  than  120k pairs  of images  are collected  from8 cities in the United States and China, including Beijing,Xiâ€™an, New York, Seattle, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Den-ver and Orlando, as shown in Figure 1. Considering the difference of culture, the United States and China are selected, since they are two typical countries in West and East, respectively.
